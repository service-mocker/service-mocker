Service Mocker is an API mocking framework for frontend developers. With the power of [service workers](https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/), we can easily set up mocking services **without any real servers**. It sets developers free from intricate workflows, complex documentations and endless proxies from server to server.

## Installation

Since you are likely to run Service Mocker only during development, you will need to add `service-mocker` as a devDependency:

```
npm install service-mocker --save-dev
```

For legacy browsers, you may also need the [polyfills](https://github.com/service-mocker/service-mocker-polyfills):

```
npm install service-mocker-polyfills --save-dev
```

## Features

- **No server is required**.
- **Real** HTTP requests and responses that can be inspected in modern browsers.
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) style routing system.
- IE10+ compatibility.

## Hello new world

A typical mocker includes two parts: `client` and `server`. First, let's create a server script named `server.js`:

```js
// server.js
import { createServer } from 'service-mocker/server';

const { router } = createServer();

router.get('/greet', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello new world!');
});

// or you can use the shorthand method
router.get('/greet', 'Hello new world!');
```

Then, we need to write a client script to connect to the server:

```js
// app.js
import 'service-mocker-polyfills';
import { createClient } from 'service-mocker/client';

const client = createClient('path/to/server.js');

client.ready.then(async () => {
  const response = await fetch('/greet');

  console.log(await response.text());
});
```

After that, create a `.html` file and include **ONLY** the client script:

```html
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

Now navigate your browser to your local dev server (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`). Open the console and you will see the following messages:

```
> [mocker:modern] connection established
>
> Hello new world!
```

Welcome to the future :clap:.

## Working with webpack

While using webpack, it's recommended to use [sw-loader](https://github.com/idiotWu/sw-loader) to create a standalone server script:

```js
import scriptURL from 'sw-loader!path/to/server.js';
import { createClient } from 'service-mocker/client';

const client = createClient(scriptURL);

client.ready.then(...);
```
